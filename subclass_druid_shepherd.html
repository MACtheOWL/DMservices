Beasts can understand your speech, and you can decipher their noises and motions. This ability doesn't grant special friendship, but you can use it to curry favor with them.</td>

The spiritâ€™s aura has various effects based on the spirit type. You can use this ability once per short or long rest. Options: Bear Spirit, Hawk Spirit, Unicorn Spirit.</td>
