Your spirit resembles your mortal form and can stay out for 1 hour or until concentration is broken. You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and you can cast conjuration or necromancy spells without verbal, somatic, or material components (except gold costs). You also gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. While using Form of Dread, you regain hit points when dealing necrotic damage.
