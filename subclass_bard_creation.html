                <td>When you give a creature a Bardic Inspiration die, you create a Tiny mote of potential that orbits within 5 feet of that creature. The mote is intangible and invulnerable, lasting until the Bardic Inspiration die is used or lost. It provides additional effects depending on how the die is used: <br>
                    <b>Ability Check:</b> The creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die twice and choose the result.<br>
                    <b>Attack Roll:</b> The mote explodes, forcing nearby creatures to make a Constitution saving throw or take thunder damage.<br>
                    <b>Saving Throw:</b> The mote vanishes, granting the creature temporary hit points equal to the Bardic Inspiration roll plus your Charisma modifier.</td>

                    You can use this feature once per long rest, or by expending a 2nd-level spell slot. At 6th level, you can create Large items, and at 14th level, you can create Huge items.</td>

                    The item shares your initiative and can act independently but defaults to the Dodge action unless commanded as a bonus action. You can also command it as part of the same bonus action used for Bardic Inspiration.<br>
                    This feature recharges after a long rest, or by expending a 3rd-level spell slot.</td>
