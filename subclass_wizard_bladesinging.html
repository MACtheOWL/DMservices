                <td>When you adopt this tradition at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with light armor, and you gain proficiency with one type of one-handed melee weapon of your choice. You also gain proficiency in the Performance skill if you donâ€™t already have it.</td>

                <td>Bladesong</td>
                <td>Starting at 2nd level, you can invoke an elven magic called the Bladesong, provided that you aren't wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield. It graces you with supernatural speed, agility, and focus. You can use a bonus action to start the Bladesong, which lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated, if you don medium or heavy armor or a shield, or if you use two hands to make an attack with a weapon. You can also dismiss the Bladesong at any time (no action required).
                <br><br>While your Bladesong is active, you gain the following benefits:
                <ul>
                    <li>You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</li>
                    <li>Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.</li>
                    <li>You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.</li>
                    <li>You gain a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make to maintain your concentration on a spell. The bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</li>
                </ul>
                You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</td>
