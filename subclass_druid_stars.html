                <td>At 2nd level, you create a star chart that serves as a spellcasting focus. You gain the Guidance cantrip and the Guiding Bolt spell, which doesn't count against your prepared spells. You can cast Guiding Bolt a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses after a long rest. If lost, you can recreate it through a 1-hour ceremony during a short or long rest.</td>

Depending on whether you roll an even or odd number, you gain access to Weal (add a d6 to a creature’s roll) or Woe (subtract a d6 from a creature’s roll). You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining uses after a long rest.</td>
