                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Bottled Respite:</strong> As an action, you can magically vanish and enter your vessel. The vessel is an extradimensional space with a 20-foot-radius cylinder and resembles your vessel. You can remain inside for a number of hours equal to twice your proficiency bonus, and you can leave the vessel at any time with a bonus action. The vessel is destroyed if you die, and it vanishes in a flare of elemental power when you die.</li>
                        <li><strong>Genie's Wrath:</strong> Once during each of your turns when you hit with an attack roll, you can deal extra damage equal to your proficiency bonus, with the type determined by your patron (bludgeoning for Dao, thunder for Djinni, fire for Efreeti, or cold for Marid).</li>

Additionally, as a bonus action, you can give yourself a flying speed of 30 feet for 10 minutes, which allows you to hover. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all expended uses after a long rest.</td>

Additionally, anyone who remains in the vessel for at least 10 minutes gains the benefit of finishing a short rest, and they can add your proficiency bonus to any hit points they regain if they spend any Hit Dice during a short rest.</td>

You don’t need to meet the requirements in that spell, and it takes effect as part of this action. This feature can only be used once, and you can’t use it again until you finish 1d4 long rests.</td>
