    <p>You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Lunar Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.</p>

    <p>Whenever you finish a long rest, you can choose what lunar phase manifests its power through your magic: Full Moon, New Moon, or Crescent Moon. While in the chosen phase, you can cast one 1st-level spell of the associated phase in the Lunar Spells table once without expending a spell slot. Once you cast a spell in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>

You become invisible until your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell.</li>

You can bring one willing creature within 5 feet, teleporting them to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of your destination. Both you and the creature gain resistance to all damage until the start of your next turn.</li>
