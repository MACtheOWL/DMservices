                <td>Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you can temporarily alter the physical properties of one nonmagical object, changing it from one substance into another. You perform a special alchemical procedure on one object composed entirely of wood, stone (but not a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into a different one of those materials. For each 10 minutes you spend performing the procedure, you can transform up to 1 cubic foot of material. After 1 hour, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), the material reverts to its original substance.</td>

A creature gains a benefit of your choice as long as the stone is in the creature's possession. When you create the stone, choose the benefit from the following options:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet</li>
                        <li>An increase to speed of 10 feet while the creature is unencumbered</li>
                        <li>Proficiency in Constitution saving throws</li>
                        <li>Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice whenever you choose this benefit)</li>

                    <br>Each time you cast a transmutation spell of 1st level or higher, you can change the effect of your stone if the stone is on your person.

                <td>Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to consume the reserve of transmutation magic stored within your transmuter's stone in a single burst. When you do so, choose one of the following effects. Your transmuter's stone is destroyed and can't be remade until you finish a long rest.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Major Transformation: You can transmute one nonmagical object – no larger than a 5-foot cube – into another nonmagical object of similar size and mass and of equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes handling the object to transform it.</li>
                        <li>Panacea: You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons affecting a creature that you touch with the transmuter's stone. The creature also regains all its hit points.</li>
                        <li>Restore Life: You cast the Raise Dead spell on a creature you touch with the transmuter's stone, without expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in your spellbook.</li>
                        <li>Restore Youth: You touch the transmuter's stone to a willing creature, and that creature's apparent age is reduced by 3d10 years, to a minimum of 13 years. This effect doesn't extend the creature's lifespan.</li>
