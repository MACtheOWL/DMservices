    <h1>Oath of Glory Paladin Subclass Features</h1>

    <h2>Tenets of Glory</h2>
    <p>The tenets of the Oath of Glory drive a paladin to attempt heroics that might one day shine in legend:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Actions over Words:</strong> Strive to be known by glorious deeds, not words.</li>
        <li><strong>Challenges Are but Tests:</strong> Face hardships with courage, and encourage your allies to face them with you.</li>
        <li><strong>Hone the Body:</strong> Like raw stone, your body must be worked so its potential can be realized.</li>
        <li><strong>Discipline the Soul:</strong> You must marshal the discipline to overcome failings within yourself that threaten to dim the glory of you and your friends.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Oath Spells</h2>
    <p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed below:</p>
    <table border="1" style="width: 100%; text-align: left; border-collapse: collapse;">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Paladin Level</th>

    </table>

    <h2>Channel Divinity</h2>
    <p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Peerless Athlete:</strong> As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to augment your athleticism. For the next 10 minutes, you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks; you can carry, push, drag, and lift twice as much weight as normal; and the distance of your long and high jumps increases by 10 feet (this extra distance costs movement as normal).</li>
        <li><strong>Inspiring Smite:</strong> Immediately after you deal damage to a creature with your Divine Smite feature, you can use your Channel Divinity as a bonus action and distribute temporary hit points to creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you, which can include you. The total number of temporary hit points equals 2d8 + your level in this class, divided among the chosen creatures however you like.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Aura of Alacrity</h2>
    <p>At 7th level, you emanate an aura that fills you and your companions with supernatural speed, allowing you to race across a battlefield in formation. Your walking speed increases by 10 feet. In addition, if you aren't incapacitated, the walking speed of any ally who starts their turn within 5 feet of you increases by 10 feet until the end of that turn.</p>
    <p>When you reach 18th level in this class, the range of the aura increases to 10 feet.</p>

    <h2>Glorious Defense</h2>
    <p>When you reach 15th level, you can turn defense into a sudden strike. When you or another creature you can see within 10 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to grant a bonus to the target's AC against that attack, potentially causing it to miss. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). If the attack misses, you can make one weapon attack against the attacker as part of this reaction, provided the attacker is within your weapon's range.</p>
    <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

    <h2>Living Legend</h2>
    <p>At 20th level, you can empower yourself with the legends — whether true or exaggerated — of your great deeds. As a bonus action, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You are blessed with an otherworldly presence, gaining advantage on all Charisma checks.</li>
        <li>Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack and miss, you can cause that attack to hit instead.</li>
        <li>If you fail a saving throw, you can use your reaction to reroll it. You must use this new roll.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.</p>
