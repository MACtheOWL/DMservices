                <td>At 3rd level, echoes of those who have died cling to you. Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can gain one skill or tool proficiency of your choice, as a ghostly presence shares its knowledge with you. This proficiency lasts until you choose a different one with this feature.</td>

                You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses after a long rest.</td>

                You gain the following benefits while you have a soul trinket:<br>
                - Advantage on death saving throws and Constitution saving throws.<br>
                - When dealing Sneak Attack damage, you can destroy a trinket to use Wails from the Grave without expending a use.<br>
                - You can destroy a trinket to ask the spirit one question. The spirit answers concisely but isn't compelled to be truthful.</td>

While in this form, you have a 10-foot flying speed, can hover, and attacks against you have disadvantage. You can also move through creatures and objects as difficult terrain, but take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside one.<br><br>
                You can use this feature once per long rest, or by destroying a soul trinket as part of the bonus action to activate it.</td>

                - Wails from the Grave now deals necrotic damage to both the first and second creature.<br>
                - At the end of a long rest, if you have no soul trinkets, one appears in your hand as the spirits of the dead seek you out.</td>
