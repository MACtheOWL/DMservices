                <td>At 3rd level, your study of death allows you to extract vitality from dying creatures. When you reduce a creature within 5 feet of you to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier + your monk level (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).</td>

                <td><strong>Hour of Reaping</strong></td>
                <td>At 6th level, you can unsettle or terrify those around you. As an action, each creature within 30 feet that can see you must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</td>
            </tr>

                <td><strong>Mastery of Death</strong></td>
                <td>At 11th level, you can escape death itself. When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can expend 1 ki point (no action required) to remain at 1 hit point instead.</td>

            <tr>
                <td><strong>Touch of the Long Death</strong></td>
                <td>At 17th level, you can channel the energy of death into a creature. As an action, you touch one creature within 5 feet and expend 1 to 10 ki points. The target makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d10 necrotic damage per ki point spent on a failure, or half as much on a success.</td>
