As an action, you present your holy symbol, and any magical darkness within 30 feet of you is dispelled. Each hostile creature within 30 feet must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes radiant damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level on a failed save, and half as much on a successful one. A creature with total cover from you is unaffected.</td>
